what is my definition of truth?

- a combination of fact, experience, + perception
- in my opinion, there is no true definition of truth (lol) because everyone has a different perception of reality
- there are certain things that everyone can agree is true b/c it's scientifically and factually undeniable-- gravity is real, the earth is round etc
- but with things like religion, politics, + philosophy truth is much more subjective + relies more on personal experience and perception
- therefore truth is mostly about the facts, but in more nebulous areas, experience and perception shapes what the truth is

what is my system for figuring out the truth?

1. look @ the source: is it reliable, what biases does it have, etc (including people + myself; try to understand their/my thought process)
2. break the fact/belief down: try to understand its implications, relevance, and purpose
  > for something to be true you do not have to be 100% certain about it. this step is mostly about trying to poke holes in the fact/belief to see if there's anything worth questioning.
3. compare: look for contradicting evidence, its source(s), and repeat steps 1 + 2 for that opposing fact/belief
4. come to a conclusion: if the source is reliable, there are no flaws or further questions in the implications, and the opposing evidence isn't as good or is less believable, than it is true.

ex: the earth is round
1. look @ the source: there are many well-tested ways to prove this, frm observing lunar eclipses to scientific calculations --> the facts are reliable
2. break the fact/belief down: this impacts gravity, time zones, weather, etc --> impact is clear + difficult to disprove
3. compare: opposing evidence is mostly abt distrust in govt. agencies + mainstream media + has been debunked --> opposing evidence is not true
4. come to a conclusion: the facts are reliable, the effect it has is obvious + hasn't been debunked, + opposing evidence is false --> it's true that the earth is round
